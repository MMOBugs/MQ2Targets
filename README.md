# MQ2Targets

MQ2Targets allows you to create a custom list of watched targets to be displayed in your HUD. You must have HUD enabled (F11) to be able to view your watch list. Also you can enable a pop up notify message as well for watch targets in addition to the list. The target list is displayed in the hud sorted by distance by default (customizable) with level/class/distance/direction indicated (also customizable).

Besides mobs which can be shown on the HUD, the list is also available via the ${Targ} TLO.
